## Overview

Weather Agent is an LLM-powered assistant that lets users ask weather questions in plain English — *"Will it rain in Chennai tomorrow?"* or *"What's it like in Tokyo this weekend?"* — and get a clear, conversational answer grounded in live data.

The project was built to explore practical, end-to-end agent design: combining a low-latency LLM with a real-time external API, handling ambiguous user input, and producing reliable, grounded responses rather than hallucinated ones.

## Why This Project

This agent demonstrates core skills relevant to applied AI engineering:

- **Tool-augmented LLM design** — the model doesn't guess weather data, it retrieves and reasons over real API responses.
- **Prompt engineering** — structured prompts translate free-form user input into precise API parameters (location, date range, intent).
- **API integration** — geocoding and live weather retrieval via Open-Meteo, with no paid dependencies.
- **Fast inference** — built on Groq's LLaMA 3 for low-latency conversational responses.
- **Clean, modular architecture** — separation between query understanding, data retrieval, and response generation.

## Demo

```
You: What's the weather in Chennai right now?
Agent: It's currently 31°C and partly cloudy in Chennai, with humidity at 68%.

You: Should I carry an umbrella tomorrow?
Agent: Yes — there's a high chance of rain in Chennai tomorrow afternoon,
        with temperatures around 27°C. Better safe than sorry!
```
